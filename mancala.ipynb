    "# Mancala: Player vs AI\n",
    "In this project we have implemented a playable version of mancala using python with **slight rule tweaks**. We then proceeded to go try and test a few different types of AI to use as an opposing \"computer\" player for the humans to play against. These strategies were tested in this order:\n",
    "1. Random moves.\n",
    "2. Minimax\n",
    "3. Minimax with alpha beta pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to produce an AI that plays signficantly better than the random AI while running in real time without the user or player having to wait for long periods of time while the AI computes.\n",
    "## Rule changes to our mancala\n",
    "Our game of Mancala plays much like the normal version of mancala. We have varying sized boards that don't impact gameplay, but our main tweak to the original Mancala is:\n",
    "1. If your last stone for your turn lands in your Mancala, you don't get to make another move. In other words, the turn always alternates every time a player makes a move without exception.\n",
    "## How to play\n",
    "In the cell below we define a series of variables with comments explaining what they do. You can simply toggle on your preferred variables and then run the code. If a player is playing, you will have to send your moves through the CLI by typing a valid number seen in the printed Mancala board."
